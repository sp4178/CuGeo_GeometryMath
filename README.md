# CuGeo: Geometry Problem Solving with Multimodal Combinatorial Reasoning

## Overview

CuGeo presents a novel approach to Geometry Problem Solving (GPS) by integrating multimodal combinatorial reasoning. This approach is designed to bridge the gap in performance for geometry reasoning tasks which require both textual and visual information processing.

## Introduction

CuGeo addresses the challenge of measuring reasoning abilities in computational models through complex GPS. Unlike existing models, CuGeo excels in handling the unique demands of GPS by effectively integrating visual and contextual information.

## Key Contributions

* **Advanced Multimodal Reasoning**: CuGeo leverages both textual and visual information to enhance accuracy in solving geometry problems.
* **Error Analysis and Model Improvement**: A unique approach to error analysis led to significant improvements in handling images and text in GPS.
* **Integration with Large Language Models**: The model effectively combines vision encoders with large language models (LLMs) like Phi-2 and CLIP, showcasing an advanced level of multimodal understanding.
